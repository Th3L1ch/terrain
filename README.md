# Fantasy map generator

This is code for generating fantasy maps, using the algorithm behind [@unchartedatlas][uncharted]. For more details, see [these notes][notes].

## Dependencies

This code depends on the following:

 * [D3.js][d3] (tested with version 4.2.0)
 * Adam Hooper's [js-priority-queue][priority]
 * My [language generation code][language]

# Hey
I'd like to add a small feature to this project, the ability to add your own points to the map manually.
If this works it'll be here, if not I'll probably delete the fork.
